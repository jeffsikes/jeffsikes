## Advice to those new to programming
Make many mistakes, have fun, and never stop learning.

My first website was a [Scooby Doo Fan Page on GeoCities](https://web.archive.org/web/19970807200333/http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/1145/). I made enough on ad revenue to buy a new computer and [a digital camera that stored images on floppy disk](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sony_Digital_Mavica_MVC-FD81.jpg).  I was even featured in [a book about GeoCities](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-GeoCities-Websites-Ben-Sawyer/dp/0966288912/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CQ94LKCVU6B7&keywords=Geocities&qid=1669000443&s=books&sprefix=geocities%2Cstripbooks%2C75&sr=1-1)!  While the site may be laughable in today's standards, I learned many valuable lessons: image, audio and video editing; html; php, linux, shell commands; how to make ad revenue.

This silly little site ended up helping me attain my first job working in the tech industry.  I used to be embarassed because the site was so terrible.  I now own it proudly as my first baby steps into a new profession.

I hope you can look back on your work someday and cringe as well. :)

Happy coding.
